# Development environment

The plan's deployment target is one Docker Compose stack on one AWS host. For
development the same components run natively, which is faster to iterate against
and, for the database layer, tests the real thing rather than a stand-in.

## Database

PostgreSQL 16 with PostGIS 3.4, GEOS, GDAL and PROJ. GeoDjango needs all four.

```sh
apt-get install -y postgresql-16-postgis-3 postgresql-16-postgis-3-scripts
pg_ctlcluster 16 main start
su postgres -c "psql -c \"CREATE ROLE routemaker LOGIN PASSWORD 'routemaker' SUPERUSER;\""
su postgres -c "createdb -O routemaker routemaker"
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -U routemaker -d routemaker -c "CREATE EXTENSION postgis;"
./manage.py migrate
```

## What migrations do and do not create

`Segment` is `managed = False` on purpose, so `migrate` does not create it. The
weekly rebuild writes segment data into a staging schema and renames it into
place, so its DDL comes from the pipeline; a migration that owned the table
would fight the swap. Anything anchored to a segment — comments, issues,
closures, cue overrides, reviewer penalties — refers to it by plain columns
rather than a foreign key, because a cross-schema constraint would make the
rename impossible.

Test and CI databases therefore take segment DDL from the pipeline, not from
`migrate`.

## When the database stops

In an ephemeral container the cluster does not survive an idle period: the
process is killed uncleanly rather than shut down, so the next run finds a stale
pid file. A test run that fails with "connection refused" rather than with
something about the code usually means this. One command fixes it:

```sh
scripts/devdb.sh
```

It is idempotent, creates the role, database and PostGIS extension if they are
absent, and waits for the socket before returning.


## The worker

Procrastinate runs through its Django integration, so its job tables are
ordinary migrations and the worker is a management command:

```sh
./manage.py migrate                      # includes the procrastinate_* tables
./manage.py procrastinate worker         # every queue; compose splits them
```

Compose runs two workers from the same task module: `worker` on the
`maintenance` queue (the backup and the membership sweep, in the API image) and
`rebuild` on the `rebuild` queue (the weekly rebuild, in the pipeline image that
carries the Valhalla and GDAL binaries, with the data volume mounted at
`/data`). The queue split is what puts the six-hour build in the container with
the binaries and the 8 GB limit rather than in the API's.

A worker started any other way does not work. `procrastinate --app=... worker`
never sets Django up: it dies on the missing schema, and with the schema applied
by hand every task raises `AppRegistryNotReady`. The suite starts a worker cold
in a subprocess and runs a job through it for exactly this reason.

## Reference data

The rebuild refuses to run without three files under `<DATA_ROOT>/reference/`,
because each stood in for real data in an early version and each produced a
plausible, wrong map when empty. `scripts/install_reference_data.py` installs
them:

```sh
python scripts/install_reference_data.py --data-root "$DATA_ROOT" \
    --extract "$DATA_ROOT/extracts/source.osm.pbf" \
    --urban-areas tl_2024_us_uac20.geojson \
    --volume vdot-aadt.geojson --volume-source vdot --volume-year 2024
```

- `crossings.json` is `fixtures/crossings/potomac-anacostia.json`, copied. Its
  content is community knowledge maintained under the fixture's own README;
  the rebuild logs every row it cannot match against the extract.
- `urban-areas.json` is the list of OSM way ids that intersect a Census urban
  area. The input is the Census TIGER/Line urban-areas layer
  (`tl_<year>_us_uac20`), converted to GeoJSON with `ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON
  -t_srs EPSG:4326`. Intersection rather than containment, so a street that
  leaves the boundary is still graded against urban speeds.
- `volume.json` is every agency count line with a bidirectional AADT, in the
  shape `conflation.AgencyFeature` loads. The Virginia layer is VDOT's traffic
  volume export from the Virginia Roads portal (`--volume-source vdot`, AADT
  property `AADT`); Maryland's and the District's arrive the same way with
  their own source names. Directional counts are summed before they reach
  here, which is why the property name is an argument rather than guessed.

Run with only `--data-root`, the script installs the crossings and exits
non-zero naming whichever of the other two is still missing.

## Tiles and the swap

Each variant's tiles live under `<DATA_ROOT>/tiles/<variant>/`: a dated build
directory per rebuild (`20260917T080000Z/`, holding `tiles/`, `tiles.tar` and
the build config), and a `current` symlink the serving container mounts. The
checked-in configs name `/data/tiles/<variant>/current/...`, which resolves to
the same host file inside the rebuild container (data volume at `/data`) and
the serving one (that directory at the same path). The rebuild builds through
a derived config with `current` replaced by the dated directory, promotes by
replacing the symlink, keeps `previous` for rollback, and repoints the
`valhalla_upstream` table before renaming the schema.

`valhalla_service` does not reload tiles, so after a promotion the serving
containers are restarted to load the new extract (`docker compose restart
valhalla-standard valhalla-no-trail valhalla-ebike`); starting them against the
new build before stopping the old ones is the blue/green arrangement the plan
describes and phase 1 does not implement. `pipeline.promotion.rollback` undoes
a completed swap: schema, tiles and settings table together.

## Container notes

Docker's daemon runs in this development container, but image layer pulls are
blocked by the egress proxy, so the Compose stack cannot be brought up here. It
is written to be validated on the deployment host. The native database above is
the loop to develop against in the meantime.

## Lua

The tag transform runs under LuaJIT, because Valhalla 3.5.1's build requires it
(`pkg_check_modules(LuaJIT REQUIRED IMPORTED_TARGET luajit)`) and its own
`graph.lua` calls `bit.bor`, which stock Lua 5.2 and later do not provide. Code
under `lua/` therefore has to stay within Lua 5.1 syntax; `//`, the bitwise
operators and `goto` parse under a developer's `lua5.4` and fail inside the
container, where the failure shows up as Valhalla silently falling back to its
compiled-in transform rather than as a crash.

```sh
apt-get install -y luajit lua5.4
```

`lua/vendor/graph_upstream.lua` is Valhalla's own transform at the pinned
version, checked in so the entry-point contract can be tested against the real
file. Refresh it with `scripts/vendor_valhalla_lua.sh`; do not edit it.

Setting `CI=1` turns the suite's missing-interpreter skips into failures.

## Running the suite twice at once

**A private `PGDATABASE` is enough on its own.** Each Postgres database is its
own namespace, so two runs against two different databases cannot drop each
other's schemas no matter what either one names `live` and `staging` — the
whole failure mode below only exists when two runs share one database.

```sh
PGDATABASE=routemaker_b .venv/bin/python -m pytest
```

`ROUTEMAKER_LIVE_SCHEMA` and `ROUTEMAKER_STAGING_SCHEMA` exist for the
narrower case that actually needs them: two runs sharing one database — a
shared CI Postgres instance, say — where the `live`, `staging` and `live_old`
schema names themselves would otherwise collide and each run would drop the
other's tables mid-test, producing failures that read as code defects rather
than as contention. `tests/test_schema_swap.py` and the rest of the suite take
their schema names from the `segment_schemas` fixture and from
`settings.SEGMENT_SCHEMA_LIVE` / `SEGMENT_SCHEMA_STAGING` rather than writing
`"live"` / `"staging"` as literals, so setting these alongside a private
`PGDATABASE` is safe:

```sh
PGDATABASE=routemaker_shared \
ROUTEMAKER_LIVE_SCHEMA=live_b \
ROUTEMAKER_STAGING_SCHEMA=staging_b \
  .venv/bin/python -m pytest
```

The suite is green both with these two variables unset and with them set to
non-default names; both invocations are exercised before either is relied on.

The production side has no such literals either: the rebuild's staging schema, the
writers' live guard and the swap all read the settings, and
`tests/test_pipeline_end_to_end.py` runs a whole rebuild under renamed schemas to hold
them to it.
